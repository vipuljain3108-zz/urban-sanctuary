                    <br/><br/><b>Orientation: Security</b> - how ecologically and socially conscious is the sourcing of the raw materials?

                    <br/><br/><b>Context statement:</b> In the broadest thinking terms, life on our planet relies on the interlocking of three key pillars: healthy Biospheric services, the biodiversity of life and the vital cultural diversity of humans.

                    <br/><br/><b>Guiding Question:</b> To what extent does the sourcing (cultivation and extraction) of the raw materials necessary to produce the Service (built form, a product or service or facility) enhance the diversity of life, that is, aids the greater biospheric services of the planet, the localised eco systems (species and habitat protection) and preserves the associated knowledge, customs and prosperity of the indigenous cultures of the territory?

                        At the Sanctuary we use the top of the line Inbody Scanner, the Inbody 770. A highly accurate, medically approved body composition scanner which can accurately measure, report and track your physique and general health.
                        <br /><br />Each scan provides a detailed report and health score of your physical composition including; muscle, bone and fat mass, and water composition analysis (ECW). Importantly this machine can measure visceral fat to the percentage point - so that you can rescan more regularly to ensure the program you are on is effective. 
                        <br /><br />This is also the only scanner that can provide information on Phase Angle for more specialised health and anti-aging information. The true age of a human being can be determined by changes in PhAs, a remarkable window into the health of the body, which decreases with age, however when you increase your PhAs, you slow down aging.

This personalised data is delivered within 20 minutes via a German Based Digital Epigenetic Mapping Service, all from the scan of four of your hair strands and roots. The Cell Wellbeing test helps to provide a piece of the puzzle around personalised nutritional epigenetic mapping, as well as personalised optimisation strategies.
                    <br/><br/>Your epigenetic report highlights potential functional impacts caused by Environmental Toxins, Electro Magnetic Impacts, Nutritional Diet, Life Style and Underlying Food Stressors. Each report also provides nutritional advice on optimising your wellbeing. The Sanctuary uses this specific test to help evaluate a wide range of nutritional information including: Vitamins, Minerals, Amino Acids, Fatty Acids, and Anti-Oxidants to help craft the nutritional optimisation of meal plans.

                    At the Sanctuary we believe that great skin is a reflection of inner health, and that full health and hence true beauty shows itself through the radiance of the eyes, hair and skin. Health and Beauty is represented by what is going on inside of your mind-body, and by the way you protect, nurture and nourish your skin and hair. 
                    <br/><br/>A skin test will reveal not just the condition of your skin, and how to externally look after it, but also contributes to an overview of our comprehensive heath testing services. This holistic health map can identify toxins, nutrient deficiencies, as well as other health conditions which impact appearance, all important information that can then be cross referenced to integrate a natural improvement program for you to achieve greater Vitality and Longevity - which will involve glowing, youthful skin.
                    <br/><br/>We recommend using the fully natural and nutrient rich Vision Products skin and hair care range, along with specialised treatments to compliment this authentic beauty approach.

                        Oxygen is transported to the blood within the body through the respiratory system and blood oxygen can be potentially influenced by fresh air, water intake, iron rich foods, exercise, and breathing exercise for additional amounts of oxygen to the lungs and greater energy. This Finger Pulse Oximeter is a simple, yet accurate way for spot-checking blood oxygen saturation levels (and pulse rate) through a fast, and pain free process by simply attaching the device to the finger.

                    Increased blood pressure can cause health issues and primary hypertension is high blood pressure that develops gradually over time. High blood pressure is most common in adults and is influenced by lifestyle habits such as regular exercise, weight control, healthy diet, and limiting stress, alcohol and tobacco.

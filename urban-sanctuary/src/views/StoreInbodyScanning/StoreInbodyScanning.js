              <h4>About Sanctuary Inbody Scan</h4>
              <p>We believe in the importance of understanding your full body health for a complete wellbeing. It is not just about knowing what you weigh, but more about how the weight is distributed within your body. Our medically approved InBody scanner can accurately measure, report and track your results. The Inbody scanner along with our Health creator and Weight Shifter app can help you track and understand your body better to achieve the best required results.
              </p>
              <p>We at Urban Sanctuary use one of the best Inbody scanner, Inbody 770. It is highly accurate and gives a detailed report of your body composition including your water composition analysis.
              </p>
              <p>This Inbody scanner uses Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis method for measuring body composition, including muscle mass, body fat, and total body water. Alternating low and high-frequency electrical currents are sent through the water in the body via contact with electrodes to measure impedance. </p>

              <h4>Our Scanner </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Quickly measure fat mass, muscle mass, and body water. Auto-calibrated, user-friendly, and non-invasive, testing is fast and easy—just stand on the device and hold the hand electrodes.Additionally, most brands choose 3d body scans over BIA due to the imaging. Showing both data & body imaging is a powerful client experience.
                </li>
                <li>No empirical estimations based on age, sex, ethnicity, or body type. Instead, Direct Segmental Multi-Frequency BIA technology measures body segments separately for an accurate analysis based on your unique body.
                </li>
                <li>Get vital body composition outputs for evaluating overall health and wellness and a specialized Result Sheet for body water analysis. Draw more insights from exclusive metrics like Visceral Fat Area and Whole Body Phase Angle, track body composition and body water changes, optimize regimens, and give tailored health recommendations backed by research-grade data.
                </li>
                <li>With accurate results and abundant measurement outputs, the InBody770 is a premium body composition analyzer which is used for medical research, patient’s monitoring, sports medicine, and so on. Many of the world’s famous hospitals and doctors are using the InBody770 as a research tool as it is providing plenty of parameters which can be used as a research source. The InBody Result Sheet displays your body composition measurements in a clear, easy-to-read way to make understanding your results simple.</li>
